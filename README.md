# Smart Daily Expense Tracker - Android App

**Developer:** Abhilash Kumar Jha  
**Technology Stack:** Android, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, MVVM Architecture

## üì± App Overview

A comprehensive expense tracking application designed for small business owners, featuring real-time expense management, intelligent analytics, and offline-first architecture. The app provides an intuitive interface for tracking daily expenses, generating detailed reports, and gaining business insights through AI-powered analytics.

## ü§ñ AI Usage Summary

This project was developed using **AI-native development practices** with extensive collaboration with AI assistants. Key AI usage included:
- **Architecture Design**: AI helped design Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern, implementing proper separation of concerns
- **Code Generation**: AI assisted in generating boilerplate code, UI components, and business logic implementations
- **Problem Solving**: AI helped debug issues, optimize performance, and implement complex features like real-time updates
- **Testing Strategy**: AI guided the creation of comprehensive unit tests for all layers (Domain, Data, Presentation)

## üìù Prompt Logs

### Key Prompts Used:

**1. Initial Project Setup:**
```
"Build a full-featured Smart Daily Expense Tracker module for small business owners using Jetpack Compose with a clean MVVM architecture. Include Expense Entry Screen, Expense List Screen, Expense Report Screen, State Management & Data Layer, and Bonus Challenges like theme switcher, persist data locally, animation on add, duplicate detection, validation, offline-first sync, reusable UI components."
```

**2. Architecture Implementation:**
```
"Complete missing Clean Architecture components - implement Domain layer, UseCases, and proper Dependency Injection"
```

**3. Feature Implementation:**
```
"Go ahead with Phase 2 implementation" - Implemented theme switcher, enhanced animations, advanced search & filtering, enhanced charts & analytics, offline sync, intelligent insights, and performance optimization
```

**4. Testing Implementation:**
```
"Write unit test for each layer" and "Write unit test for other layer also domain, data presentation"
```

**5. CI/CD Integration:**
```
"Integrate CI/CD pipeline" and "Integrate SonarQube for code quality checking"
```

**6. Real-time Updates Fix:**
```
"The item which I am adding is showing in list screen only after second time app launch, but I want it to update immediately"
```
